# 📘 2NF Explained – Second Normal Form

## 📖 Introduction

Second Normal Form (2NF) is the next level of normalization after 1NF.
It focuses on **eliminating partial dependencies** to reduce redundancy and avoid anomalies in tables with **composite primary keys**.

2NF ensures that **non-key attributes depend on the whole primary key**, not just a part of it.

---

# 🧩 What is Second Normal Form (2NF)?

A relation (table) is in **2NF** if:

### ✔ 1. It is already in **1NF**

(Meaning: atomic values, no repeating groups)

### ✔ 2. It has **no partial dependency**

Every non-key attribute must depend on the **entire primary key**, not on a subset of it.

---

# 🔍 What is Partial Dependency?

A **partial dependency** occurs when:

```
Composite Key: (A, B)
Non-key attribute: C
If A → C
But (A, B) → C is the actual key
```

This means the non-key attribute **C** depends only on part of the primary key (A), not the whole composite key.

This violates 2NF.

# ❌ Example: Table NOT in 2NF

| Student_ID | Course  | Student_Name |
| ---------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 1          | DBMS    | Rafiq        |
| 1          | Web Dev | Rafiq        |
| 2          | DBMS    | Zihan        |

### Primary Key → (Student_ID, Course)

### Functional Dependencies:

```
(Student_ID, Course) → Student_Name  (key dependency)
Student_ID → Student_Name            (partial dependency ❌)
```

### Why is this not in 2NF?

- **Student_Name** depends only on **Student_ID**, not on the full composite key.
- This creates unnecessary repetition of names for every course.

---

# ✔ Convert the Table to 2NF (Proper Design)

We fix partial dependency by **splitting the table**.

---

## **1️⃣ Students Table (Independent attributes)**

| Student_ID | Student_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Rafiq        |
| 2          | Zihan        |

---

## **2️⃣ Enrollments Table (Composite key attributes)**

| Student_ID | Course  |
| ---------- | ------- |
| 1          | DBMS    |
| 1          | Web Dev |
| 2          | DBMS    |

### Now the schema satisfies:

- No partial dependency
- Each non-key attribute depends on the entire key
- Redundancy removed

---

# 🧠 Why Is 2NF Important?

2NF solves problems caused by partial dependencies:

### ✔ Eliminates redundant data

Student names no longer repeat for each course.

### ✔ Avoids update anomaly

Updating a student’s name once fixes it everywhere.

### ✔ Prevents insertion anomaly

You can add a new student even if they are not yet enrolled.

### ✔ Removes deletion anomaly

Deleting a course enrollment won’t delete the student's identity.

# 📝 Real-Life Easy Example

### ❌ Not in 2NF:

| Order_ID | Product_ID | Customer_Name |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 1001     | P-01       | Rafiq         |
| 1001     | P-02       | Rafiq         |

Composite Key → (Order_ID, Product_ID)

Partial dependency:

```
Order_ID → Customer_Name   ❌
```

### ✔ Convert to 2NF:

**Orders Table**

| Order_ID | Customer_Name |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1001     | Rafiq         |

**Order_Items Table**

| Order_ID | Product_ID |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1001     | P-01       |
| 1001     | P-02       |

# 🖼 2NF Concept Diagram

```
Before 2NF:
-----------------------------------------
Composite Key (A, B)
Non-key Attribute C
C depends only on A  → Partial Dependency ❌
-----------------------------------------

After 2NF:
-----------------------------------------
Separate the table into:
1. Table with key A (attributes depending on A)
2. Table with composite key (A, B)
-----------------------------------------
```

| Concept            | Explanation                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1NF                | Ensures atomic values                              |
| 2NF                | Removes partial dependencies                       |
| Composite Key      | A key formed by two or more attributes             |
| Partial Dependency | Non-key attribute depends on part of composite key |
| Goal of 2NF        | Reduce redundancy & prevent anomalies              |

# 🏁 Final Notes

2NF ensures that:

- Each non-key attribute depends on the **whole** primary key
- No attribute is partially dependent
- Data becomes cleaner, smaller, and easier to maintain

2NF is essential before moving on to **3NF**, which handles **transitive dependencies**.

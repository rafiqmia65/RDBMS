# 📘 Third Normal Form (3NF) — Explained

## 📌 Introduction

**Third Normal Form (3NF)** is a level of database normalization that helps eliminate redundancy, improve data integrity, and make relational databases more efficient.
It builds on **1NF** and **2NF**, providing stronger guarantees of consistency by removing indirect dependencies.

---

## ✅ What is 3NF?

A table is in **Third Normal Form (3NF)** if:

1. **It is already in Second Normal Form (2NF)**
2. **It has no transitive dependencies**

   - Meaning:
     **Non-key attributes should NOT depend on other non-key attributes.**
     Every non-key column must depend _only_ on the primary key.

---

## 🔍 Understanding Transitive Dependency

A **transitive dependency** occurs when:

```
A → B → C
```

Where:

- `A` = primary key
- `B` = non-key attribute
- `C` = non-key attribute dependent on `B`

This creates indirect dependency and causes update, insertion, and deletion anomalies.

## 📉 Example of a Table Not in 3NF

### ❌ Student Table (Not 3NF)

| student_id | student_name | course_id | course_name | teacher_name |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1          | Alice        | C101      | DBMS        | Dr. Smith    |
| 2          | Bob          | C101      | DBMS        | Dr. Smith    |

### 🔎 What is wrong here?

- `course_name` depends on `course_id`
- `teacher_name` also depends on `course_id`
  → These are **transitive dependencies**, making the table violate 3NF.

---

## ✅ Convert the Table to 3NF

To achieve 3NF, split the table into smaller relational tables.

### 1. **Students Table**

| student_id | student_name | course_id |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1          | Alice        | C101      |
| 2          | Bob          | C101      |

---

### 2. **Courses Table**

| course_id | course_name | teacher_name |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| C101      | DBMS        | Dr. Smith    |

---

## 🎯 Result

Now:

- No column depends on another non-key column
- Each non-key attribute depends only on the primary key
- Redundancy is reduced
- Updates become simpler and consistent

---

## 🧠 Why Use 3NF?

### ✔ Advantages

- Eliminates transitive dependencies
- Reduces duplicate data
- Ensures higher data integrity
- Improves update and maintenance efficiency

### ⚠ When Not to Use?

In **analytics-heavy systems** (e.g., data warehouses), strict normalization may reduce performance.
In such cases, **denormalization** or **star schema** might be preferred.

## 📚 Summary

| Normal Form | Requirement                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1NF**     | No repeating groups, atomic values                  |
| **2NF**     | No partial dependency (applies to composite keys)   |
| **3NF**     | No transitive dependency between non-key attributes |

3NF ensures that **every field depends only on the primary key and nothing else**, making your database consistent, scalable, and maintainable.

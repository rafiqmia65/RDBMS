# **Candidate Keys, Subsets & Proper Subsets Explained**

A **Candidate Key** is one of the most important concepts in relational database design. Understanding candidate keys, subsets, and proper subsets helps ensure proper table structure, data integrity, and efficient querying.

## **1. What Is a Candidate Key?**

A **Candidate Key** is a **minimal super key**—meaning:

- It can **uniquely identify** each row in a table.
- It contains **no unnecessary attributes**.
- A table can have **multiple candidate keys**.
- The **Primary Key** is chosen **from** the set of candidate keys.

**Example Table: Students**

| student_id | email                             | phone        | name  |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ | ----- |
| 101        | [a@gmail.com](mailto:a@gmail.com) | 01711-111111 | Rafiq |
| 102        | [b@gmail.com](mailto:b@gmail.com) | 01711-222222 | Rahim |

Possible keys:

- `{student_id}` → unique
- `{email}` → unique
- `{phone}` → unique

Since each one is **minimal and unique**, each is a **candidate key**.

## **2. Relationship Between Super Key and Candidate Key**

| Concept           | Meaning                                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Super Key**     | Any set of attributes that uniquely identify a row |
| **Candidate Key** | A minimal super key with no extra attributes       |

**Every Candidate Key is a Super Key,**
but **not every Super Key is a Candidate Key** (because super keys can contain extra unnecessary attributes).

Example:

- `{student_id, email}` → also unique → **Super Key**
- But it's **not minimal**, so **not** a Candidate Key.
- `{student_id}` → minimal → **Candidate Key**

---

## **3. What Is a Subset?**

A **subset** is any combination of attributes taken from a larger set.

Example set:

```
{student_id, email, phone}
```

Possible subsets:

```
{student_id}
{email}
{phone}
{student_id, email}
{student_id, phone}
{email, phone}
{student_id, email, phone}
{}
```

A subset can be:

- 1 attribute
- 2 attributes
- the full set
- or even empty set ({})

---

## **4. What Is a Proper Subset?**

A **proper subset** is a subset that **does not contain all elements** of the original set.

Example:

Set A:

```
{student_id, email}
```

Proper subsets:

```
{student_id}
{email}
```

Not a proper subset:

```
{student_id, email} (same as original set)
```

**Key point:**
A **Candidate Key must be a Super Key whose every proper subset is _not_ a Super Key.**

---

## **5. How Proper Subsets Help Identify Candidate Keys**

To check if a set of attributes is a **Candidate Key**, you must test whether its **proper subsets fail to uniquely identify** rows.

Example Set:

```
{email, phone}
```

Check proper subsets:

- `{email}` → unique ✔
- `{phone}` → unique ✔

Since the subsets are already unique, the combined set `{email, phone}` is **not minimal** → **not a Candidate Key**.

Another example:

```
{student_id}
```

Proper subsets:

- `{}` → not unique
- no other subsets

Conclusion:

- `{student_id}` is minimal and unique → **Candidate Key**

## **6. Summary Table**

| Concept           | Definition                               | Example                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Super Key**     | Any key that uniquely identifies rows    | `{student_id, email}`           |
| **Candidate Key** | Minimal Super Key                        | `{student_id}`                  |
| **Subset**        | Any selection of attributes              | `{email, phone}`                |
| **Proper Subset** | Subset that is smaller than the full set | `{email}` from `{email, phone}` |

---

## **7. Final Takeaway**

- A **Candidate Key = Minimal Super Key**
- **Minimal** means no proper subset can uniquely identify rows.
- Understanding subsets and proper subsets helps determine whether a super key is minimal.
- A table can have many candidate keys, but only one is selected as the **Primary Key**.

# **Relationship Cardinality and ER Diagrams**

Understanding relationship cardinality is a key part of database design. It defines **how many instances of one entity can be associated with instances of another entity**. ER (Entity–Relationship) diagrams visually represent these relationships using standardized symbols.

This document explains cardinality, types of relationships, and the symbols used in ER diagrams (Crow’s Foot, Chen, UML).

---

## **1. What Is Cardinality?**

**Cardinality** describes the **numeric constraints** between entities—how many records in Entity A relate to how many records in Entity B.

Example:

- One **Customer** can place **multiple Orders**
- One **Order** belongs to **one Customer**

This numeric mapping is expressed through cardinality.

# **2. Types of Relationship Cardinality**

There are **three main cardinality types** in relational databases:

---

## 🔹 **1. One-to-One (1:1)**

### **Meaning:**

Each entity instance relates to **one and only one** instance of the other entity.

### **ERD Symbol (Crow’s Foot)**

```
EntityA ─│───│─ EntityB
```

### **Example:**

- One person has one passport
- One student has one ID card

---

## 🔹 **2. One-to-Many (1:N)** (Most Common)

### **Meaning:**

One entity instance relates to **many** instances of another entity.

### **ERD Symbol (Crow’s Foot)**

```
EntityA ─│───<─ EntityB
```

### **Example:**

- One customer places many orders
- One teacher teaches many courses

---

## 🔹 **3. Many-to-Many (M:N)**

### **Meaning:**

Many records of Entity A relate to many records of Entity B.

### **ERD Symbol (Crow’s Foot)**

```
EntityA ─<───>─ EntityB
```

### **Example:**

- Students enroll in many courses
- Courses are taken by many students

### **Note:**

Relational databases **cannot directly store M:N** relationships.
They must be broken into:

```
Student ─│───< Enrollment >───│ Course
```

# **3. Participation Constraints (Optional vs Mandatory)**

Cardinality also includes **participation types**:

---

## 🔹 **Optional (0)**

An entity **may or may not** participate.

**Symbol:** Circle `◯`

```
◯───│
```

**Example:**
A customer _may_ have zero orders.

---

## 🔹 **Mandatory (1)**

An entity **must** participate.

**Symbol:** Single bar `│`

```
│───│
```

**Example:**
Every order must belong to exactly one customer.

---

# **4. Cardinality Symbols (Crow’s Foot Notation)**

Crow’s Foot notation is the **most widely used** ER diagram style.

| Symbol  | Meaning          | Cardinality            |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| `◯`     | Zero             | Optional participation |
| `│`     | One              | Mandatory (exactly 1)  |
| `<`     | Many             | Crow’s Foot (many)     |
| `◯───<` | Zero or Many     | 0..\*                  |
| `│───<` | One or Many      | 1..\*                  |
| `◯───│` | Zero or One      | 0..1                   |
| `│───│` | One and Only One | 1..1                   |

# **5. Full Relationship Examples With Symbols**

---

## **Example 1: One-to-Many (Mandatory–Optional)**

**One Customer** must have **0 or many Orders**.

```
Customer ─│───<─ Order
```

---

## **Example 2: One-to-One (Optional–Mandatory)**

A person _may_ have one passport,
but a passport **must** belong to one person.

```
Person ─◯───│─ Passport
```

---

## **Example 3: Many-to-Many (Mandatory–Mandatory)**

Students and Courses:

```
Student ─<───>─ Course
```

(In practice becomes: Student ─│───< Enrollment >───│ Course)

# **6. ER Diagram Components (With Symbols)**

ER diagrams also use various symbols for entities, attributes, relationships.

---

## **1. Entities**

| Symbol           | Meaning     |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Rectangle        | Entity      |
| Double Rectangle | Weak Entity |

---

## **2. Attributes**

| Symbol      | Meaning               |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Oval        | Attribute             |
| Double Oval | Multivalued Attribute |
| Dashed Oval | Derived Attribute     |
| Underline   | Primary Key           |

---

## **3. Relationships**

| Symbol         | Meaning                  |
| -------------- | ------------------------ |
| Diamond        | Relationship             |
| Double Diamond | Identifying Relationship |
| Line (solid)   | Strong/identifying       |
| Line (dashed)  | Weak/non-identifying     |

---

# **7. UML Notation (Alternative Notation)**

UML uses numeric notation:

| Symbol | Meaning      |
| ------ | ------------ |
| `0..1` | Zero or One  |
| `1`    | Exactly One  |
| `0..*` | Zero or Many |
| `1..*` | One or Many  |

Example:

```
Customer 1 —— 0..* Order
```

---

# **8. Summary Table**

| Relationship | Example Symbol | Meaning                         |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| One-to-One   | `│───│`        | Each entity relates to only one |
| One-to-Many  | `│───<`        | Most common relationship        |
| Many-to-Many | `<───>`        | Requires bridge table           |
| Optional     | `◯`            | May not participate             |
| Mandatory    | `│`            | Must participate                |

# LIMIT & OFFSET Pagination (SQL & PostgreSQL)

This document explains **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** for implementing **pagination** in **SQL and PostgreSQL**. It is written in a professional format suitable for `README.md`, GitHub documentation, and backend interview preparation.

---

## 1. What Is Pagination?

Pagination is the process of **splitting large result sets into smaller pages**. It improves:

- Performance
- User experience
- Network efficiency

In SQL, pagination is commonly achieved using **LIMIT** and **OFFSET**.

---

## 2. LIMIT Clause

`LIMIT` restricts the **maximum number of rows** returned by a query.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

### Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
LIMIT 10;
```

✔ Returns only the first 10 rows.

---

## 3. OFFSET Clause

`OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows **before returning results**.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
OFFSET number_of_rows;
```

### Example

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
OFFSET 10;
```

✔ Skips the first 10 rows and returns the rest.

---

## 4. LIMIT with OFFSET (Pagination)

LIMIT and OFFSET are commonly used together for pagination.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
LIMIT page_size OFFSET skip_rows;
```

---

### Example: Page-Based Pagination

```sql
-- Page 1
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 0;

-- Page 2
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;

-- Page 3
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

---

## 5. Calculating OFFSET

```text
offset = (page_number - 1) × page_size
```

Example:

- Page number: 3
- Page size: 10
- OFFSET = (3 − 1) × 10 = 20

---

## 6. Pagination with ORDER BY (Important)

Always use `ORDER BY` with pagination to ensure **consistent results**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20 OFFSET 40;
```

Without `ORDER BY`, row order is **not guaranteed**.

---

## 7. LIMIT & OFFSET in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL fully supports standard SQL pagination syntax.

Alternative syntax (PostgreSQL supports both):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
OFFSET 10 LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 8. Performance Considerations

- OFFSET becomes **slower on large tables**
- Large OFFSET values force the database to scan skipped rows
- Suitable for **small to medium datasets**

---

## 9. Alternative: Keyset Pagination (Brief)

For large datasets, consider **keyset pagination**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE id > 100
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 10;
```

✔ Faster and more scalable than OFFSET

---

## 10. Best Practices

- Always use `ORDER BY` with LIMIT & OFFSET
- Use reasonable page sizes (10–50 rows)
- Avoid large OFFSET values in production
- Consider keyset pagination for high-traffic systems

---

## 11. Summary

- LIMIT controls number of rows returned
- OFFSET skips rows before returning data
- Together they enable pagination
- PostgreSQL supports efficient pagination with best practices

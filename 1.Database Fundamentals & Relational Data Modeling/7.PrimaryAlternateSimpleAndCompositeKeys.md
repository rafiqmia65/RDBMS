# **Primary, Alternate, Simple & Composite Keys (Fully Explained)**

Keys define how data is uniquely identified inside a relational database. Without keys, tables would contain duplicate records, broken relationships, and inconsistent data.

This document explains four foundational key types:

- **Primary Key**
- **Alternate Key**
- **Simple Key**
- **Composite Key**

Each section includes purpose, characteristics, examples, and where the key is used in real database design.

# **1. Primary Key**

A **Primary Key (PK)** is the _main_ unique identifier for each row in a table.
Among all candidate keys in a table, **only one is selected as the primary key**.

### **Characteristics of a Primary Key**

- Must be **unique**
- Cannot be **NULL**
- There is **only one** primary key per table
- Should be **stable** (value should not change)
- Should be **minimal** and easy to reference
- Automatically creates a **unique index**

### Example Table: Students

| student_id (PK) | email                             | name  |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- | ----- |
| 101             | [a@gmail.com](mailto:a@gmail.com) | Rafiq |
| 102             | [b@gmail.com](mailto:b@gmail.com) | Rahim |

Here:

- `student_id` uniquely identifies each record
- Even if email or name changes, `student_id` remains constant
- That’s why it’s chosen as the **Primary Key**

### **When to Use a Primary Key**

- Every table **must** have one
- Ideal for referencing rows from other tables
- Essential for relationships (Foreign Keys)

# **2. Alternate Key**

An **Alternate Key** is any **candidate key that was NOT chosen** as the primary key.

Think of it like:

> "An alternate option for uniquely identifying rows."

### Example

Candidate Keys in a table:

- `student_id`
- `email`
- `phone`

If we choose:

- **Primary Key = student_id**

Then:

- `email` and `phone` become **Alternate Keys**
  (because they can also uniquely identify rows)

### Why Alternate Keys Matter

- They enforce **additional uniqueness**
- Useful for searching, login systems, admin checks
- Example: Users must have unique emails → alternate key constraint

# **3. Simple Key**

A **Simple Key** is a key made up of **one single attribute**.

### Examples of Simple Keys

- `student_id`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `nid_number`
- `username`

Each one consists of **only one column**, so it is a **simple key**.

### Simple Keys Can Be:

- Primary Keys
- Candidate Keys
- Alternate Keys
- Super Keys

As long as it is **one field**, it is considered a **Simple Key**.

### Why Simple Keys Are Preferred

- Easy to index
- Easy to search
- Easy to use as foreign keys
- No extra join logic needed

# **4. Composite Key**

A **Composite Key** is a key made up of **two or more attributes** combined together to uniquely identify a record.

Use a composite key when:

- No single field is unique
- Uniqueness comes only from **combining multiple fields**
- Handling many-to-many relationships
- Designing junction/bridge tables

### Example Table: Order Details

| order_id | product_id | quantity |
| -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 10       | P01        | 2        |
| 10       | P02        | 1        |

Here:

- `order_id` alone = duplicates exist
- `product_id` alone = duplicates exist
- `{order_id, product_id}` combined = **unique**

So `{order_id, product_id}` is a **Composite Key**.

### Where Composite Keys Are Commonly Used

- **Junction tables** (many-to-many relationships)
  Example: `student_course`
  PK = `{student_id, course_id}`

- **Transaction detail tables**

- **Log tables**

- **Audit tables**

### Advantages of Composite Keys

- Prevent duplicate combinations
- Maintain real-world relationships
- No need for artificial surrogate keys in some cases

# **Differences at a Glance**

| Key Type          | Attributes | Meaning                   | Example                  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Primary Key**   | 1 or many  | Main unique identifier    | `student_id`             |
| **Alternate Key** | 1 or many  | Other candidate keys      | `email`, `phone`         |
| **Simple Key**    | Exactly 1  | One-column key            | `email`                  |
| **Composite Key** | 2 or more  | Multiple columns combined | `{order_id, product_id}` |

# **Real-World Analogy**

Think of a student in a school:

- **Primary Key** → Student ID card (main identification)
- **Alternate Key** → Birth certificate, passport (also unique but not used as the primary)
- **Simple Key** → A single item like NID number
- **Composite Key** → "Name + Date of Birth" combined to recognize someone (only works when combined)

---

# **Final Summary**

- A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each row and is the main identifier.
- **Alternate Keys** are other candidate keys that can also uniquely identify rows.
- A **Simple Key** has exactly one attribute.
- A **Composite Key** has two or more attributes used together to ensure uniqueness.

Understanding these keys ensures:

- Proper table design
- Zero duplication
- Strong data integrity
- Correct relationships between tables

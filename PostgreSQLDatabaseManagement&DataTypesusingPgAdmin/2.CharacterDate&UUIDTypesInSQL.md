# Character, Date & UUID Types in SQL & PostgreSQL

This document provides a explanation of **Character**, **Date & Time**, and **UUID** data types in **SQL**, with PostgreSQL-specific details. It is suitable for README.md files, database documentation, and interview preparation.

---

## 1. Character (String) Data Types

Character data types are used to store **textual data** such as names, emails, descriptions, and messages.

---

### 1.1 Character Types in SQL

| Data Type  | Description                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| CHAR(n)    | Fixed-length character string    |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable-length character string |
| TEXT       | Variable-length unlimited text   |

---

### 1.2 Character Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL fully supports standard SQL character types and efficiently handles large text values.

| Type       | Behavior                         | Use Case                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| CHAR(n)    | Fixed length, padded with spaces | Country codes, fixed formats |
| VARCHAR(n) | Variable length with limit       | Names, emails                |
| TEXT       | Unlimited length                 | Descriptions, comments       |

> ⚠️ PostgreSQL treats `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` almost identically in performance.

---

### 1.3 Example: Character Types

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
  bio TEXT
);
```

---

## 2. Date & Time Data Types

Date and time types are used to store **temporal data**, such as creation dates, schedules, and timestamps.

---

### 2.1 Date & Time Types in SQL

| Data Type | Description          |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| DATE      | Stores calendar date |
| TIME      | Stores time of day   |
| TIMESTAMP | Stores date and time |

---

### 2.2 Date & Time Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL provides advanced date and time handling with timezone support.

| Type        | Description                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| DATE        | Date only                      |
| TIME        | Time only                      |
| TIMESTAMP   | Date and time without timezone |
| TIMESTAMPTZ | Date and time with timezone    |
| INTERVAL    | Time duration                  |

---

### 2.3 Example: Date & Time Usage

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  delivery_time INTERVAL
);
```

---

### 2.4 Common Date Functions

```sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE;
SELECT NOW();
SELECT AGE(NOW(), created_at) FROM orders;
```

---

## 3. UUID Data Type

UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a **128-bit value** used to uniquely identify records across distributed systems.

---

### 3.1 UUID in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL has native support for UUIDs.

| Feature        | Description     |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Size           | 16 bytes        |
| Uniqueness     | Globally unique |
| Collision Risk | Extremely low   |

---

### 3.2 Generating UUIDs in PostgreSQL

Enable extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

Generate UUID:

```sql
SELECT uuid_generate_v4();
```

---

### 3.3 Example: UUID as Primary Key

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## 4. When to Use UUID vs SERIAL

| Feature             | SERIAL      | UUID            |
| ------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| Readability         | Easy        | Complex         |
| Security            | Predictable | Hard to guess   |
| Distributed systems | ❌          | ✅              |
| Performance         | Faster      | Slightly slower |

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Use `VARCHAR(n)` when length limits are required
- Prefer `TEXT` for long or unknown-length content
- Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` instead of `TIMESTAMP` for timezone safety
- Use UUIDs for public APIs and distributed systems

---

## 6. Summary

- Character types store textual data
- Date & Time types manage temporal information
- UUID ensures global uniqueness
- PostgreSQL provides powerful and flexible support for all these data types

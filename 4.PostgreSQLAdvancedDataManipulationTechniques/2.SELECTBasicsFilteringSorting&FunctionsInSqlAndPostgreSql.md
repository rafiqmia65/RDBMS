# SELECT Basics: Filtering, Sorting & Functions (SQL & PostgreSQL)

This document provides a **professional and structured explanation of SELECT query fundamentals** in **SQL & PostgreSQL**, including sorting, filtering, comparison operators, pattern matching, and functions. It is ideal for `README.md`, GitHub documentation, and interview preparation.

---

## 1. SELECT Statement Basics

The `SELECT` statement is used to **retrieve data** from one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;
```

---

## 2. Sorting & Column Aliases

### 2.1 ORDER BY (Sorting)

Used to sort query results.

```sql
SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

- `ASC` → Ascending (default)
- `DESC` → Descending

---

### 2.2 Column Aliases

Aliases rename columns in query results for better readability.

```sql
SELECT name AS employee_name, salary AS monthly_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

## 3. DISTINCT & WHERE Filtering

### 3.1 DISTINCT

Removes duplicate rows from the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees;
```

---

### 3.2 WHERE Clause

Filters rows based on conditions.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

---

## 4. Filtering with AND & OR

Combine multiple conditions using logical operators.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 50000;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR' OR department = 'Finance';
```

---

## 5. Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| =        | Equal            |
| != / <>  | Not equal        |
| >        | Greater than     |
| <        | Less than        |
| >=       | Greater or equal |
| <=       | Less or equal    |

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary >= 60000;
```

---

## 6. BETWEEN & IN

### 6.1 BETWEEN

Selects values within a range (inclusive).

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 70000;
```

---

### 6.2 IN

Matches values from a specified list.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('IT', 'HR', 'Finance');
```

---

## 7. LIKE vs ILIKE

Used for pattern matching.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
```

- `LIKE` → Case-sensitive
- `ILIKE` → Case-insensitive (PostgreSQL only)

Example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE name ILIKE 'a%';
```

---

## 8. NOT Operator

Negates a condition.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department NOT IN ('HR', 'Finance');
```

---

## 9. Scalar Functions

Scalar functions return **a single value per row**.

### Common Scalar Functions

| Function | Purpose              |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| UPPER()  | Convert to uppercase |
| LOWER()  | Convert to lowercase |
| LENGTH() | String length        |
| ROUND()  | Round numbers        |
| NOW()    | Current timestamp    |

Example:

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name), LENGTH(email)
FROM users;
```

---

## 10. Aggregate Functions Explained

Aggregate functions perform **calculations on multiple rows** and return a single value.

### Common Aggregate Functions

| Function | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| COUNT()  | Number of rows |
| SUM()    | Total value    |
| AVG()    | Average value  |
| MIN()    | Minimum        |
| MAX()    | Maximum        |

Example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
       AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees;
```

---

## 11. Aggregate Functions with WHERE

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

---

## 12. Best Practices

- Use `WHERE` to reduce unnecessary data
- Prefer aliases for readability
- Use `ILIKE` for user-input search in PostgreSQL
- Avoid `SELECT *` in production queries

---

## 13. Summary

- `SELECT` retrieves data from tables
- `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR` filter rows
- `DISTINCT` removes duplicates
- `LIKE` & `ILIKE` enable pattern matching
- Scalar functions work per row
- Aggregate functions summarize data

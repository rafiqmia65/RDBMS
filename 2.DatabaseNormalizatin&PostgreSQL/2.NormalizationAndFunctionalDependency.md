# 📘 Normalization & Functional Dependency in DBMS

---

## 📖 Introduction

Modern database systems rely on **structured, consistent, and anomaly-free data**. Two fundamental concepts that support robust database design are:

- **Functional Dependencies (FDs)**
- **Normalization (1NF → BCNF)**

This documentation presents a professional overview of both concepts, along with examples, diagrams, and normalization workflows.

# 🧩 Functional Dependency (FD)

## ✔ Definition

A **Functional Dependency** describes a relationship between attributes in a relation (table).
If attribute **A** uniquely determines attribute **B**, we denote:

```
A → B
```

This means:
If two tuples share the same value of **A**, they must share the same value of **B**.

---

## ✔ Purpose of Functional Dependency

Functional dependencies help in:

- Identifying **primary and candidate keys**
- Detecting **partial and transitive dependencies**
- Validating **normal forms**
- Designing a logically structured schema

---

## 🔍 Example

Consider the relation:

| Student_ID | Student_Name | Course  |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------- |
| 1          | Rafiq        | DBMS    |
| 2          | Zihan        | DBMS    |
| 3          | Rafiq        | Web Dev |

### Valid Functional Dependencies:

```
Student_ID → Student_Name
Student_ID → Course
```

### Not a Functional Dependency:

```
Student_Name → Course   (Incorrect)
```

Because the same name appears in multiple courses.

---

## 🧠 Types of Functional Dependencies

### 1️⃣ **Trivial Functional Dependency**

```
A → A
A,B → B
```

These are always valid.

---

### 2️⃣ **Non-Trivial Functional Dependency**

```
A → B
(B not part of A)
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Transitive Dependency**

If:

```
A → B
B → C
```

Then:

```
A → C  (transitive)
```

Example:

```
Student_ID → Department
Department → Building
Hence, Student_ID → Building
```

# 🧱 Normalization

## ✔ Definition

Normalization is the structured process of organizing data in a relational database to:

- Reduce redundancy
- Prevent insertion, update, and deletion anomalies
- Ensure data integrity
- Improve query efficiency

Normalization transforms poorly structured tables into well-organized relational schemas based on functional dependencies.

---

# 🟦 First Normal Form (1NF)

### ✔ Requirements

- All attribute values must be **atomic**
- No repeating groups or multivalued attributes
- Each field holds a single value

### ❌ Not in 1NF:

| Student | Courses       |
| ------- | ------------- |
| Rafiq   | DBMS, Web Dev |

### ✔ After 1NF:

| Student | Course  |
| ------- | ------- |
| Rafiq   | DBMS    |
| Rafiq   | Web Dev |

---

# 🟦 Second Normal Form (2NF)

### ✔ Requirements

A relation is in 2NF if:

- It is in **1NF**
- There is **no partial dependency** on a composite primary key

### ❗ Partial Dependency

Occurs when:

```
A,B → C
but A → C
```

### ❌ Not in 2NF:

| Student_ID | Course | Student_Name |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------ |

Primary Key → (Student_ID, Course)

FD:

```
Student_ID → Student_Name  (partial)
```

### ✔ After 2NF:

**Students Table**

| Student_ID | Student_Name |
| ---------- | ------------ |

**Enrollments Table**
| Student_ID | Course |

---

# 🟦 Third Normal Form (3NF)

### ✔ Requirements

A relation is in 3NF if:

- It is in **2NF**
- There is **no transitive dependency**

### ❗ Transitive Dependency

```
A → B
B → C
→ A → C  (undesirable)
```

### ❌ Not in 3NF:

| Student_ID | Department | Dept_Head |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- |

Dependencies:

```
Student_ID → Department
Department → Dept_Head  (transitive)
```

### ✔ After 3NF:

**Students Table**
| Student_ID | Department |

**Departments Table**
| Department | Dept_Head |

---

# 🟦 Boyce–Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF.
A relation is in BCNF if **for every functional dependency A → B, A must be a candidate key.**

### ❌ Not in BCNF:

| Course | Instructor |
| ------ | ---------- |

FD:

```
Instructor → Course
```

But Instructor is not a candidate key → violates BCNF.

### ✔ After BCNF:

Separate the dependency into proper relations.

| Normal Form | Eliminates              | Addresses Issues With         | Key Requirement                            |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **1NF**     | Repeating groups        | Multi-valued fields           | Atomic values                              |
| **2NF**     | Partial dependencies    | Composite key redundancy      | No attribute depends on part of the key    |
| **3NF**     | Transitive dependencies | Indirect dependencies         | Non-key attributes must depend only on key |
| **BCNF**    | Non-key determinants    | Advanced structural anomalies | Every determinant is a candidate key       |

# ✔ Final Notes

- Functional Dependencies are the **foundation** of normalization.
- Normalization reduces redundancy, improves consistency, and enhances database quality.
- Properly normalized databases are **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **free from anomalies**.
